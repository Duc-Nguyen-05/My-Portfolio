    //         Driven by a passion for turning data into actionable intelligence, I am an aspiring AI Engineer focused on <span className="text-slate-100 font-medium">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span> and <span className="text-slate-100 font-medium">Deep Learning</span>. My journey is defined by a <span className="italic text-slate-200">"learning by building"</span> mindset—transforming theoretical concepts into practical solutions.
    //         <br /><br />
    //         I have developed diverse projects, ranging from an <span className="text-blue-300 border-b border-blue-500/30">AI-powered Saltwater Intrusion predictor</span> to an automated <span className="text-blue-300 border-b border-blue-500/30">CV Ranking System</span>. Most recently, I integrated an AI Chatbot into <span className="text-blue-300 border-b border-blue-500/30">ClassPal</span>—a classroom management ecosystem—to automate workflows. Currently, I am diving deep into <strong className="text-white">Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> and <strong className="text-white">AI Agents</strong>.
    //         <br /><br />
    //         I am seeking an <strong className="text-blue-400">AI Engineer Internship</strong> where I can contribute my technical skills, learn from experienced mentors, and build impactful AI products.
